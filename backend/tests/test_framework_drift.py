"""The weekly framework-drift check (docs/BUILD_SPEC.md §23).

A stale framework pin is a quiet correctness problem: "OWASP LLM01" names
different things in different editions, so a report mapped against a version
upstream has moved past is confidently wrong. The check exists to notice.

These tests concentrate on the one way a drift check fails worst — reporting
"no drift" when it simply did not look. A lookup that returned nothing must
never land in the same bucket as a lookup that returned a matching version.
