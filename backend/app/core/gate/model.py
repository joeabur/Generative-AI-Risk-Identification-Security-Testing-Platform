"""The CI/CD security gate (docs/BUILD_SPEC.md §23).

The gate decides whether a pipeline fails. §23 makes one point sharply and
this module is built around it: *gating on unstable, low-confidence AI
findings makes pipelines flaky and gets the tool disabled by the first
adopting team.* A tool that blocks a deploy on a 2-of-5 probabilistic result
will be switched off within a week, and then it protects nothing.

So the default configuration refuses to gate on anything it cannot stand
behind, and every exclusion is reported rather than silently applied. A gate
that fails without saying which finding failed it is a gate people learn to
bypass.

Exit codes are part of the contract (§20), because CI has to tell "found
issues" apart from "refused to run":

    0  pass
    1  security gate failed
    2  configuration error
    3  authentication error
    4  scope violation
