# Roadmap

This file tracks what was deliberately deferred rather than silently stubbed,
per `docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §0 rule 5 ("if you cannot implement something
properly within the phase, do not stub it silently — omit it, and record it
here with a reason").

## Phase 1 — Foundation (this build)

Delivered: repo layout, Docker Compose (postgres/redis/backend/worker/frontend),
FastAPI + Next.js skeletons, Argon2id auth (register/login/logout/me),
Organizations/Memberships/Roles with server-enforced RBAC, hash-chained
append-only audit log, Alembic migrations, Celery wired to Redis with a
placeholder task, and a real browser-driven register → create-organization
flow. Backend: 19/19 tests passing, ruff clean, mypy --strict clean, 92%
statement coverage. Frontend: ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, Vitest (10/10), and
`next build` all clean.

Deferred out of Phase 1, with reasons:

- **`aegis-ai seed` / demo account seeding** — the Makefile intentionally has
  no `seed` target yet rather than one pointing at a module that doesn't
  exist. Lands with the demo lab (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §19, Phase 12).
- **CLI (`aegis-ai`)** — Phase 10 per the merged phase plan
  (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §26). The web app and REST API are the Phase 1–9
  surface; the CLI is a client of the same API, not a separate path.
- **GitHub Actions SHA-pinning** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` pins actions to
  version tags (`@v4`), not commit SHAs. Full SHA-pinning
  (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §23) is a Phase 11 supply-chain hardening item;
  fabricating an unverified SHA here would risk silently breaking CI, which
  is worse than a correctly-behaving version tag pending that pass.
- **Audit log table's append-only invariant is enforced by application code
  only** — no database-level `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` on the `audit_logs`
  table yet for the app's database role. Tracked for Phase 11 hardening
  alongside the rest of the security review.
- **Docker image builds were not verified end-to-end in this build
  environment** — `docker compose config` validates the compose file's
  syntax and service graph, and the Dockerfiles were reviewed by hand, but
  actually building `Dockerfile.backend`/`Dockerfile.worker`/
  `Dockerfile.frontend` requires pulling `python:3.12-slim` /
  `node:22-slim` / `postgres:16-alpine` / `redis:7-alpine` from Docker Hub,
  which this sandbox's network policy blocks (confirmed via the agent
  proxy's status endpoint: `connect_rejected — 403 to CONNECT — policy
  denial`, not a transient failure). The application itself **was**
  validated end-to-end for real: the backend was run under `uvicorn` against
  a live PostgreSQL + Redis, the frontend was built and run under `next
  start` against that backend, and a real browser-equivalent HTTP flow
  (register → session cookie → server-rendered dashboard → create
  organization → dashboard reflecting it → unauthenticated redirect) was
  driven with `curl` and passed. Building the container images themselves
  should be verified in an environment with Docker Hub access before first
  use (e.g. by the CI workflow, which runs in GitHub's own runners).
- **Rate limiting on auth endpoints** (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §17.1: "login
  rate limiting") is not implemented in Phase 1. Noted here rather than
  silently skipped; add alongside the Phase 8 REST API hardening pass.
- **JWTs are not revocable server-side** — `auth.logout` only clears the
  session cookie; a bearer token obtained before logout remains valid until
  it expires (12 hours by default). This is a real limitation to carry into
  `docs/limitations.md` once that file exists (Phase 12/13 documentation
  pass), not something to silently fix with an unscoped session-blacklist
  abstraction in Phase 1.

## Phase 2 — Safety boundary (this build)

Delivered, test-first per `docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §0 rule 4: the scope and
authorization engine (`app/core/scope/`) — the choke point every outbound
request must pass through. `RulesOfEngagement`/`Authorization`/`Budgets` as
pure, DB-independent dataclasses; `ScopeEngine.check()` (real pipeline,
consumes budget, halts the run on any hard violation) and
`ScopeEngine.explain()` (the dry-run/`scope explain` preview — identical
decision logic, never reserves budget or halts); `BudgetTracker` (atomic
request/token/cost/wall-clock reservation plus a concurrency semaphore);
`KillSwitch` (in-memory trip + sentinel-file check); `GatedTransport` (the
only place `httpx.AsyncClient`/`httpx.Client` may be constructed anywhere in
`app/`, enforced by a static test that greps the codebase and fails the
build otherwise — verified to actually catch a violation, not just pass
vacuously). `Target`/`Authorization`/`RulesOfEngagementRecord` persisted
models plus a REST API (target CRUD, RoE config, authorization grant
restricted to Owner/Admin per §17.2, and a `/scope/explain` dry-run
endpoint) — all RBAC-gated and cross-organization-isolated the same way
Phase 1's organizations API is.

Every case in the §6.3 mandated test matrix has its own test (not combined),
plus additional coverage beyond the minimum: IDN/punycode homographs,
userinfo-in-URL, DNS rebinding (proven by asserting the resolver was called
twice, not cached), cloud metadata IPs, RFC1918/loopback/link-local ranges,
explicit private-range allowlisting, path/method/header rules, all four
budget dimensions plus wall-clock and concurrency-under-load, blackout
windows, authorization absent/expired/not-yet-valid, RoE schema validation
failure, kill switch (in-memory and sentinel-file), and fail-closed behavior
on an internal exception — 84/84 backend tests passing, ruff clean,
mypy --strict clean, 99% statement coverage on `core/scope/` (target: ≥95%),
95% overall (target: ≥85%).

Deferred out of Phase 2, with reasons:

- **Redirect-target IP pinning (same-request DNS-rebinding TOCTOU)** — the
  engine re-resolves DNS fresh on every `check()` call, which catches a
  host's records changing *between* requests in a run (the DNS-rebinding
  test proves this). It does not pin the validated IP for the actual
  connection within a single request — `GatedTransport` lets `httpx`
  re-resolve DNS itself when it connects, which reopens a narrower,
  same-request TOCTOU window. Closing that requires connecting directly to
  the checked IP while preserving the original Host/SNI, a meaningfully
  larger piece of `httpx`/`httpcore` transport-level work. Tracked for the
  Phase 11 SSRF hardening pass rather than implemented partially or claimed
  as solved.
- **RPS (requests-per-second) pacing is not implemented** — `Budgets`
  carries `requests_per_second`, but only the request-count, token, cost,
  wall-clock, and concurrency dimensions are actually enforced in Phase 2.
  Actual rate-shaping (a token-bucket delay) plus a timing-based test would
  be inherently more flake-prone in CI than the other budget tests; add it
  deliberately in Phase 4 alongside the orchestrator's real request pacing,
  not as a rushed addition here.
- **Only one Authorization/RulesOfEngagement record per target** — granting
  a new authorization or setting a new RoE replaces the existing one
  wholesale rather than versioning a history. Simpler and safer than a
  half-built versioning model; revisit if the findings/evidence work in
  later phases needs to reference "the RoE that was active at scan time"
  for more than the most recent grant.
- **`/scope/explain` uses real system DNS in production** (`SystemDnsResolver`
  via a FastAPI dependency, overridden with a fake resolver only in tests)
  — this means a dry-run preview against a real target does a live DNS
  lookup, same as a real request would. That's intentional (an explain that
  used stale/cached data could mislead an operator about what would
  actually happen) but means `/scope/explain` is not fully side-effect-free
  at the network level, only budget/state-free.
- **No frontend UI for assets/scope yet** — Phase 2 is backend/API-only;
  targets, RoE, and authorization are managed via the REST API. The web UI
  for this (§18.3–18.6 in the spec) is deferred to land alongside Phase 3's
  adapter/discovery UI so it's built once against a more complete API
  surface rather than twice.
- **OpenAPI spec upload/parsing** — not part of Phase 2 despite appearing
  adjacent to "asset CRUD" in earlier phase-table drafts; it belongs with
  attack-surface discovery in Phase 3 (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §26), which is
  where it's actually implemented.

## Phase 3 — Adapters & discovery (this build)

Delivered: the adapter layer (`app/core/targets/`) and OpenAPI attack-surface
discovery (`app/core/discovery/`).

- **Adapter protocols**, split into `ConversationalAdapter` (`send(turn)`)
  and `RestSurfaceAdapter` (`operations()` / `send_operation(...)`) over a
  shared `TargetAdapter` base. The spec (§8) defines a single chat-shaped
  protocol; that shape does not fit `http_openapi`, where the unit of work
  is "call operation X with parameters". Splitting it beat inventing a fake
  `Turn` for every REST call — recorded here as a deliberate deviation.
- **`chat_http`** (JSON request template + JSONPath extraction),
  **`openai_compatible`** (`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses`
  shapes), **`http_openapi`** (spec-driven REST). All send exclusively
  through `GatedTransport`, so the Phase 2 static check still proves no
  ungated HTTP path exists.
- **Provider-reported token usage feeds `BudgetTracker.reconcile()`**, so
  §6.2's "use reported usage when available, estimate otherwise" is real
  rather than aspirational — the estimate is replaced by the truth before
  the next budget check.
- **OpenAPI 3.x parser** treating uploads as hostile input: `yaml.safe_load`
  only, remote `$ref`s refused rather than fetched (an SSRF primitive aimed
  at the scanner host), cycle-safe and depth-capped local ref resolution,
  document-size and operation-count caps, malformed path entries skipped
  rather than aborting the whole import.
- **Surface API**: spec upload (extension/size/filename validation, stored
  in the database rather than the filesystem so path traversal is
  structurally impossible), endpoint listing, and per-endpoint enable/
  disable that survives a spec re-upload.

155/155 backend tests passing, ruff clean, mypy --strict clean, 94% overall
coverage (91% across the new `core/targets` + `core/discovery` modules;
`core/scope` still at 99%).

Deferred out of Phase 3, with reasons:

- **Real tokenizer** — `app/core/targets/tokens.py` is an explicit
  ~4-chars-per-token heuristic, not a tokenizer, and says so. It is only
  used for the pre-flight estimate that reported usage then replaces.
  Adding `tiktoken` (or equivalent) is a dependency decision worth making
  deliberately alongside the AI engine in Phase 6, not smuggled in here.
- **`graphql`, `mcp`, `websocket`, `cli_subprocess` adapters** — §8 lists
  seven adapters; Phase 3's acceptance criterion names three, and those
  three are what the API/AI engines in Phases 5–6 need. The remaining four
  land when there is an engine that actually exercises them, rather than
  shipping four untested integration surfaces now.
- **Live discovery (probing well-known spec paths on a target)** — surface
  discovery is currently spec-upload-driven only. Fetching
  `/openapi.json` from a live target is a scope-gated request like any
  other and is straightforward to add; it is deferred to Phase 4, where the
  orchestrator that would run it exists.
- **Request-body parameter schemas are captured as content types only** —
  the parser records *which* media types an operation accepts, not the full
  inlined body schema. Generating valid/invalid request bodies from those
  schemas is the input-validation probe's job (§10, Phase 5), which is
  where the schema walk belongs.
- **No frontend UI for surface review yet** — same reasoning as Phase 2's
  scope UI deferral: both land together against a settled API surface.

## Phase 4 — Assessment engine (this build)

Delivered: `AssessmentRun`/`RunEvent` models with an append-only, sequenced
event log; a DB-free orchestrator (`app/core/orchestrator/`) that turns a
list of checks into a terminal run status; a Celery task that executes a run
in a worker process and persists progress as it goes; cross-process
cancellation carried over Redis into a latching `KillSwitch`; and the runs
REST API (create, list, get, events, cancel, and SSE progress). Backend:
184/184 tests passing, ruff clean, `mypy app` clean, 96% statement coverage
(scope engine still 100%, runs router 100%).

Two design points worth stating, because both are honesty requirements from
the spec rather than implementation details:

- **A halt is not automatically a failure.** Budget exhaustion ends a run as
  `completed` with a `halted_reason`, because the run did everything its
  budget permitted and the report must say so; an operator cancellation ends
  it `cancelled`; an authorization that lapses mid-run ends it `expired`.
  Only a check that raises produces `failed`.
- **Progress is never faked.** The SSE stream replays persisted `RunEvent`
  rows and nothing else, so a browser can never show progress ahead of the
  work, and it closes only once the run has reached a terminal status.

Two bugs found by running a real Celery worker rather than only the test
suite, both fixed here and both now covered by `tests/test_workers.py`:

- The worker registered no assessment task at all (`include=` was missing
  from the Celery app), so it started cleanly and discarded every queued run
  as "unregistered task" while the API kept reporting those runs as queued.
- Each Celery task runs under its own `asyncio.run`, and an asyncpg
  connection belongs to the loop that opened it, so the *second* run in any
  worker process died with "attached to a different loop". The task now
  disposes the engine before its loop closes.

Deferred out of Phase 4, with reasons:

- **The acceptance criterion "runs end-to-end against the demo lab" is met
  against a mocked target, not a lab.** The demo lab is Phase 12
  (`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §19, §26) and does not exist yet. The full path —
  API create → broker → worker → scope-gated requests → persisted events →
  terminal status — is exercised in `tests/test_runs_api.py` with the
  network faked at the `httpx` boundary (so the scope engine, budgets and
  transport are all real), and was additionally driven through a live Celery
  worker against Postgres and Redis by hand during this build. That is not
  the same as a lab, and is recorded here as the gap it is.
- **Only one check ships (`core.reachability`).** It issues one request per
  enabled endpoint and records the status or the scope rule that refused it.
  It is deliberately not a security test: the AI and API probe catalogues
  are Phases 5–6, and inventing probes now would pre-empt that work with
  untested ones. The check protocol it implements is what those catalogues
  plug into.
- **Live discovery (probing well-known spec paths) did not land here** — it
  was deferred *to* Phase 4 in the Phase 3 notes above. The orchestrator now
  exists, but the useful form of it is a check in the catalogue rather than
  a one-off, so it moves to Phase 5 with the API engine.
- **Runs are not resumable and there is no retry policy.** A worker killed
  mid-run leaves the run in `running`; nothing currently reaps it. A
  heartbeat plus a reaper is an operational concern that belongs with the
  Phase 11 hardening pass, and inventing a half-reaper now would make stale
  runs *look* handled.
- **`requests_per_second` is still not enforced** (carried from Phase 2).
  Concurrency, request count, tokens, cost and wall-clock all are; pacing
  needs a limiter shared across worker processes, which arrives with the
  rate-limiting work in Phase 11.
- **No frontend UI for runs yet** — the runs API and its SSE stream are
  complete and exercised, but the dashboard surface lands with the scope and
  surface UIs, against a settled API.
- **Cancellation fails open if Redis is unreachable.** `is_cancellation_requested`
  returns `False` on a `RedisError` rather than stopping every run, which is
  the documented trade-off in `app/workers/cancellation.py`: a genuine
  cancellation also writes a terminal status to Postgres, and the run stays
  bounded by its budgets, authorization window and wall clock regardless.

## Phase 5 — API security engine (this build)

Delivered: a probe contract (`ScanResult` per §11.1, a `Probe` protocol and
an explicit registry), sixteen API probes covering OWASP API2 (authentication,
transport, key material in URLs), API1/API5 (BOLA and function-level
authorization via authorized synthetic accounts), API3 (mass assignment),
API4 (rate-limit advertisement, pagination limits), API8/API9
(security headers, CORS, verbose errors, debug endpoints, input validation)
and GraphQL (introspection, depth/aliasing cost, error verbosity);
credential *references* with worker-side resolution; a `ScanResultRecord`
table; probe execution wired into the orchestrator; and `GET
/runs/{id}/results`. Backend: 227/227 tests passing, ruff clean, `mypy app`
clean, 95% statement coverage (scope engine still 100%).

Four decisions worth stating, because each is a deliberate limit rather than
an oversight:

- **Mass assignment is analysis-only, in every mode.** §10 requires that
  under safe mode, and safe mode is what runs ship with. Confirming mass
  assignment means writing `is_admin: true` to a real record; a tool that
  does that to prove a point has caused the incident it was hired to find.
  The specification already says whether the field is bindable, so the probe
  reports it at `DESIGN_REVIEW` confidence, clearly labelled, and never as a
  confirmed exploit. With safe mode off it says explicitly that live
  confirmation is not implemented rather than quietly behaving the same way.
- **Authorization probes need a control, and say so when they cannot get
  one.** A BOLA test asks the owning account for its own object first. Without
  that, a 404 to the second account would be reported as "correctly denied"
  when the object may simply not exist, and an endpoint that returns 200 to
  everyone would be reported as BOLA. Where no synthetic accounts are
  configured, the probe emits an explicit "not tested" result — silence
  would read as a pass on the single highest-value check in the engine.
- **A credential is never stored.** The database holds the *name* of an
  environment variable, validated to look like one so a token cannot be
  pasted in by mistake; the worker resolves it at run time into a
  `CredentialSet` that exposes it only as a request header. A test asserts
  no credential value appears in any field a report is built from.
- **A crashed probe is a visible gap, not a silent pass.** A probe that
  raises produces an `AEGIS-API-099` informational result and the run
  continues. Without it, a probe failing on every endpoint would look
  identical to a probe that found nothing — the most dangerous false
  negative a scanner can have.

Deferred out of Phase 5, with reasons:

- **The acceptance criterion is met against fixture apps, not the demo
  lab.** §26 asks for "every seeded API flaw in the demo lab; zero findings
  against a hardened control app". The lab is Phase 12 and does not exist, so
  `tests/lab/` contains two in-process applications — one carrying 17 seeded
  flaws, one built correctly — served through the real `GatedTransport` and
  the real scope engine with only the socket replaced. The engine finds all
  17 and reports nothing against the control, and removing a single
  hardening measure from the control app was checked to make that test fail.
  That is a genuine test of the engine; it is not a deployable, isolated lab,
  and this entry is the record of that difference.
- **SSRF (API7) is not implemented.** §10 requires a scope-controlled local
  collaborator in the lab, or a non-resolving canary domain against real
  targets, and is explicit that a target must never be pointed at a third
  party. The collaborator is lab infrastructure that arrives in Phase 12;
  shipping an SSRF probe without it would mean either no way to observe the
  callback, or pointing someone's API at a host we do not control. Neither is
  acceptable, so the probe waits for the lab.
- **JWT-specific authentication tests are not implemented** — `alg:none`,
  unsigned tokens, absent expiry. These need a token to manipulate, which
  means the synthetic-account credential, and the useful version of the check
  reasons about the token's structure. It belongs with the credential
  handling work rather than bolted onto the unauthenticated-access probe.
- **Spec/production drift and stale API versions (API9) are not
  implemented** — the parser records the declared surface and the probes
  exercise it, but nothing yet compares what the spec declares against what
  the server actually exposes. That needs live discovery (also deferred, see
  Phase 3/4 entries) to be worth anything.
- **No trials, ASR or confidence intervals yet.** §7's machinery applies to
  probabilistic AI probes; every API probe here is deterministic, so a single
  observation is the whole result and an ASR would be theatre. The machinery
  lands with the AI engine in Phase 6.
- **Results are not yet findings.** `ScanResultRecord` stores the §11.1 wire
  shape. Fingerprinting, risk scoring, severity rationale, mapping versions
  and lifecycle are the findings service in Phase 7, and the API deliberately
  returns no risk score rather than inventing one at the boundary.
- **No frontend UI for results yet** — same reasoning as the scope, surface
  and runs UIs: they land together against a settled API.
