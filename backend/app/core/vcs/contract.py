"""What a code-host integration is allowed to do.

The boundary is narrow and deliberate: **read a pull request's changed lines,
post a check run, post review comments.** Nothing here pushes a commit, opens a
pull request, merges one, changes a branch, or edits a file. That is not an
oversight to be filled in later — an "autofix" that writes to a customer's
repository is out of scope for this platform (docs/roadmap.md), and the way to
keep it out is to have no code that could.

Two further properties, both the same ones the notification layer has:

* **Every request goes through the scope-gated transport**, under a context
  whose allowlist holds the one code-host API hostname and nothing else
  (`egress.py`). A code-host connection cannot become a way to reach a target.
* **The token is held by reference.** A connection row stores the *name* of an
  environment variable; the value is read at post time and never persisted,
  logged, returned by the API, or put in an error string.

What gets posted is also bounded. A review comment carries a finding's title,
severity, rationale and remediation — never an evidence bundle, never a
response body, never a code snippet that a secrets engine matched. A pull
request is one of the most public places this platform writes, so the payload
is assembled from the same small scalar set the notification renderer uses and
passes the same redactor.
