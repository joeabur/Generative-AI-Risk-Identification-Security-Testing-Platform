"""Report and evidence download endpoints (docs/BUILD_SPEC.md §13, §14).

Two rules shape this module.

**No public URLs.** Every route below is behind the same membership check as
the rest of the API, so an evidence bundle or a report is reachable only by a
member of the organization that owns the run. There is no signed link, no
share token, and no unauthenticated export — §13 is explicit that evidence
must not be retrievable without authorization, and the simplest way to keep
that true is to offer no other path to it.

**Every download is audited.** A report is the artefact that leaves the
platform, and evidence is the rawest material it holds. Who took a copy, of
what, and when is part of the record, so each handler writes an audit event
before returning bytes.
