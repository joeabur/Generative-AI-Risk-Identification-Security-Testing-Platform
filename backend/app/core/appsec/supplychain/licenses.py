"""Licence classification, by SPDX identifier.

The table below is a *risk posture*, not legal advice, and the distinction is
load-bearing: what counts as acceptable depends on whether the product ships as
a binary, runs as a hosted service, or is itself open source. So the engine
reports the obligation a licence carries and leaves the decision to a human,
rather than emitting a "violation" nobody agreed the rules for.

Categories:

* `network_copyleft` — AGPL and friends. Triggers on *use over a network*, which
  is the case a SaaS team most often does not expect.
* `strong_copyleft` — GPL: derivative works must be released under the same terms.
* `weak_copyleft` — LGPL, MPL, EPL: file- or library-level obligations, usually
  satisfiable by dynamic linking and publishing modifications.
* `permissive` — MIT, BSD, Apache: attribution, and for Apache a patent grant.
* `public_domain` — CC0, Unlicense.
* `proprietary_or_unknown` — anything unrecognised, **including a missing
  licence**. Missing is not permissive, and the engine never treats it as such.
