"""The result stage: the gate decides, and nothing else gets a vote.

§26 Phase 17 requires that *an AI recommendation cannot alter a gate decision*.
This module is where that is true, and it is true structurally rather than by
policy:

* The decision comes from `gate.evaluate`, the same function the CI gate and the
  pull-request check run use. One implementation, so a workflow, a pipeline and
  a pull request cannot disagree about the same findings.
* `evaluate` takes `GateFinding`s, which are built here from a finding's **real
  columns**. AI output lives in `ai_drafts`, keyed separately, and this module
  does not import the assistant package or read that table. There is no
  parameter through which a draft could be passed in.
* A draft only ever becomes a finding's real field when a human accepts it,
  which is an ordinary write to the finding — at which point it is a human's
  decision, not the model's, and the gate reads it like any other.

`tests/test_workflow.py` asserts the property directly: a draft proposing
CRITICAL against a LOW finding changes neither the decision nor the counts.
