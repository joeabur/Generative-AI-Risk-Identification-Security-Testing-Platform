"""Detect drift between the pinned framework editions and upstream.

`docs/BUILD_SPEC.md` §23 asks for a weekly upstream framework version check
that opens an issue on drift, and §27 requires every mapping to be traceable to
a pinned version with a retrieval date. Together those mean: a pinned edition
that upstream has moved past is a silent correctness problem, because
"OWASP LLM01" names different things in different editions and a report that
does not notice is confidently wrong.

**This module makes no network requests, deliberately.** Every outbound request
in the application goes through `GatedTransport`, and a maintenance script that
opened its own connection would be a second HTTP path — the exact thing the
static check in `tests/security/` exists to prevent, weakened by putting it
just outside the directory that check scans. So the fetching happens in the
workflow, where it is visible in the job log, and this module does the part
worth testing: comparing what was fetched against what is pinned, and deciding
what that means.

It is also why `compare()` is pure. A drift report that could only be produced
by hitting the network could only be tested by hitting the network.

## Two kinds of entry, and only one can be checked automatically

Some framework editions live in a git repository with tags. Those can be
compared mechanically. Others are a published web page with no machine-readable
version — OWASP API Security's edition pages, the NIST AI RMF — and for those
a script that reported "no drift" would be reporting that it did not look.
`ReviewDue` is what it reports instead, driven by the retrieval date.
