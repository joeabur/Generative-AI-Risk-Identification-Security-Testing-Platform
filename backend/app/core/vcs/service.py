"""Publishing a run's findings to a pull request.

The order of operations is the interesting part, because each step can fail in
a way the next must not paper over:

1. **Resolve the connection.** Token from the environment, host pinned or
   sanctioned. A failure here is final — the same configuration fails the same
   way — and is recorded as a refusal rather than retried.
2. **Read the diff first.** Before deciding what to say, find out which lines
   GitHub will actually render an annotation on. Doing this after building the
   check run would mean discovering the answer too late to move the unanchored
   findings into the body.
3. **Evaluate the gate.** The check run's conclusion comes from the same
   `evaluate()` the CI gate uses, so a pull request and a pipeline cannot
   disagree about whether the same findings are a blocker.
4. **Post once.** One check run carrying everything, rather than a check run
   plus a review: two writes mean two chances to half-succeed, and a review
   comment on a line the check run already annotated is the same message twice.

Nothing here writes to the repository. See `contract.py`.
